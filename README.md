# Text-to-Speech

In this project, I created a text to speech converter.
Here, I've mainly used the GTTS module.(Python library and CLI tool to interface with Google Translate's text-to-speech API.)



What is GTTS module?


gTTS (Google Text-to-Speech), a Python library and CLI tool to interface with Google Translate's text-to-speech API. Writes spoken mp3 data to a file, a file-like object (bytestring) for further audio manipulation, or stdout . It features flexible pre-processing and tokenizing.
